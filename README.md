# FlatIron School - Phase 4 Project
Phase 4 Project for FlatIron School SE Program.

# Requirements:
For this project, you must: 
- Use a Rails API backend with a React frontend, 
- Have at least three models on the backend, that include: 
- At least one one-to-many relationship
- At least one many-to-many relationship
- Full CRUD actions for at least one resource 
- Have at least three different client-side routes using React Router. Be sure to include a nav bar or other UI element that allows users to navigate between routes.
- Implement authentication/authorization, including password protection. A user should be able to log in to the site with a secure password and stay logged in via user ID in the session hash.

# Description
The goal of this project is to apply what was taught throughout Phase 1 - Phase 4 of the Software Engineering program to create a fully functional, low-level, fitness tracking application. This application is built using a Rails API backend and a React frontend. Throughout this project, I will cover how to allow users to create accounts, how to allow users to log in if they have already created an account, how to securely store users credentials in your database, and how to add what is necessary to make this fully functional. 

# Features 

For this project, I decided to build a simple fitness tracking application in which a user can: 
- Create a new account/sign up for the site
- Log into a pre-existing account on the site
- View a list of all workouts created by users on the site
- Create a new Workout post
- Modify or delete a Workout that I created
- Like a Workout
- Create a Comment for one specific Workout post
- Log out


# Getting Started 
Note: Before you continue, this assumes you have Ruby, RubyGems, and Bundler installed on your system. 

To get started with Rails, make sure the gem is installed and you are running the latest version of Rails: 
```console
$ gem install rails 
```

# Setup

To get set up, run: 
```console
$ bundle install
$ npm install --prefix client

You can run the rails server with:
